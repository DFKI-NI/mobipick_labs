mobipick_tables_demo
====================

Code for the "tables" demo on 2022-07-12.

Scenario description
--------------------

See this [wiki page](https://git.ni.dfki.de/mobipick/documentation/-/wikis/Mobipick-tables-demo).


Installation
------------

This demo might install a lot, depending on what you already have on your
system. Your catkin workspace for mobipick, if you don't mind adding further
repositories, or a new catkin workspace with only this repository is
recommended to start with. [vcs](https://pypi.org/project/vcstool/) and
[wstool](http://wiki.ros.org/wstool) will be installed when needed,
ROS and Python 3 are assumed to be available on your system.

```bash
./install-deps.sh
./build.sh
```

Real robot demo
---------------

Start up the robot according to the [instructions on the
wiki](https://git.ni.dfki.de/mobipick/documentation/-/wikis/starting-up-the-robot),
then:


```bash
roslaunch mobipick_bringup mobipick_bringup_both.launch   # already part of the startup instructions
roslaunch pbr_dope dope.launch
roslaunch tables_demo_bringup bringup.launch
```

To start the full tables demo, then run:

```bash
rosrun tables_demo_planning tables_demo_node.py  # optional: <number of target table>, e.g., "4"; default: 2
```

To start the power drill pick&place demo, run:

```bash
rosrun tables_demo_planning pick_n_place_demo_node.py
```


Gazebo demo
-----------

```bash
roslaunch tables_demo_bringup demo_sim.launch
rosrun tables_demo_planning tables_demo_node.py
```

Optionally for visualization:

```bash
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find tables_demo_bringup`/config/pick_n_place.rviz __ns:=mobipick
```

Grasping/Placing/Inserting objects demo (using grasplan)
--------------------------------------

Goal of the robot in this demo is to

- test grasplan
- grasp multiple objects in simulation
- useful for debugging

```bash
roscore
roslaunch tables_demo_bringup demo_sim.launch robot_x:=12.43 robot_y:=2.21 robot_yaw:=1.5708
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find tables_demo_bringup`/config/pick_n_place.rviz __ns:=mobipick
```

Pick

```bash
rosrun grasplan pick_obj_test_action_client __ns:=mobipick power_drill_with_grip table_1
```

Optionally you can specify a list of objects to ignore/delete from planning scene. This will allow e.g. to pick
a box with objects inside it. To run do:

```bash
rosrun grasplan pick_obj_test_action_client __ns:=mobipick power_drill_with_grip table_1 object_to_ignore_1 object_to_ignore_2 ...
rosrun grasplan pick_obj_test_action_client __ns:=mobipick klt table_1 multimeter_1
```

Place

```bash
rosrun grasplan place_obj_test_action_client __ns:=mobipick table_3 true
```

Insert

```bash
rosrun grasplan insert_obj_test_action_client __ns:=mobipick klt_3 true
```

If you want to grasp the other objects you can use the following robot pose.

```bash
roslaunch tables_demo_bringup demo_sim.launch robot_x:=10.46 robot_y:=2.47 robot_yaw:=3.1415
```

If you want to grasp another object after picking, please place the object first.


Pick-and-place demo on the real robot
-------------------------------------

Goal of the robot in this demo is to

- fetch the power drill from the table,
- hand it over to a person,
- return empty-handed to its home position.

```bash
roslaunch mobipick_bringup mobipick_bringup_both.launch
roslaunch pbr_dope dope.launch
roslaunch mobipick_pick_n_place mobipick_pick_n_place.launch world:=moelk_tables_demo
rosservice call /mobipick/continue_statemachine
```

Plan visualization
------------------

Install and source this
[dot_graph_visualization](https://git.ni.dfki.de/acting/dot_graph_visualization)
module, then call it with:

```bash
rqt --standalone dot_graph_visualization
```

pre-commit Formatting Checks
----------------------------

This repo has a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) check that runs in CI.
You can use this locally and set it up to run automatically before you commit
something. To install, use pip:

```bash
pip3 install --user pre-commit
```

To run over all the files in the repo manually:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

To run pre-commit automatically before committing in the local repo, install the git hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
